# JobScrapper
The idea behind JobScrapper(name pending) web app is to streamline the job hunting experience. Currently there are many sites dedicated to finding jobs.However, these sites only post information they receive from potential employers. There is no standardized format for employers follow, and that often times leads to job posting with unclear and unnecessary information. Through the use of machine learning, text summarization, and web scraping, our web app will make the job-hunting process less tedious by creating a standardized format with information relevant to a potential job-hunters.
