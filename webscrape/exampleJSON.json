ODS is a five-week program that provides a comprehensive and intense introduction to the responsibilities of Navy Staff Corps Officers.

There may be an option for attendees to request to split the five-week program into two sessions.\n\nEducation Opportunities\nBeyond professional credentials and certifications, Intelligence Officers can advance their education by:\n\nPursuing opportunities at institutions such as Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) or Navy War College (NWC)\nCompleting Joint Professional Military Education (JPME) at one of the various service colleges\nBeyond professional credentials and certifications, Intelligence Officers can advance their education by:\n\nPursuing opportunities at institutions such as Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) or Navy War College (NWC)\nCompleting Joint Professional Military Education (JPME) at one of the various service colleges\nQualifications &amp; Requirements\nA four-year degree from a regionally accredited institution is required to work as an Intelligence Officer.
